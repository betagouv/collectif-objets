# Security Policy 

## Updates Policy

We try and keep our dependencies as updated as possible. 
We update most dependencies within a few dates of their releases thanks to dependabot. 
A few major updates can take up to a month or so if it takes a lot of work or we are depending on a sub-dependency getting upgraded. 
We try never to lag behind a major update for more than 3 months.
